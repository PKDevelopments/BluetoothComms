Bitmap Testing Notes
12 SEP:
-Two devices can connect with each other on Bluetooth using AsyncTasks
-Reobtained ability to send messages to the InfoThread
-Can read characters sent by other device. But only characters. 

13 SEP:
-Successfully retooled Threads to allow for background processing of InfoExchangeThread (do NOT make new runnables inside new threads when starting them or they will run in the main thread!!!)

14 SEP:
-The application will check for new sent messages every second
-Basic functionality established. A ListView keeps track of all messages received (yes, only received..currently) by the other person and can be deleted.
-Toast messages added to inform user when connectivity has been established and lost.
-Allows the user to select which device to connect to, vice being hardwired to one MAC address (Note: The devices in question must be paired in Bluetooth first!!)


**Follow On Plans:**
-Allow the ListView to maintain a record of the entire conversation (with a record of which user said what)
-Fix Egyptian Rat Screw game or find another means to integrate this Bluetooth wireless interface to...
